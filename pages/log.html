        <td class="td3">- On the women's records pages (US Open, American, and NCAA), there is gold text at the top right that says "Records set at 2023 NCAAs." New records set at the 2023 NCAAs will be gold instead of white. Currently, only UVA's 200 Medley Relay time is golden.</td><tr></tr>

		<td class="td3">- Fixed some spacing issues on the Women's US Open records page. "Speedo Champions Series - Greensboro" was a bit too long of a title, and it caused some words to get overlapped. The "Greensboro" part has been removed.</td><tr></tr>

For the individual 50s (Breast and Fly), it's difficult to find the fastest times ever. Individual 50s for those aren't swam at NCAAs, so the best times I could find came from the 50 split in the 100.</td><tr></tr>

        <td class="td3">- On the home page, the buttons for "US Open," "American," and "NCAA" are now larger. The button can be clicked by pressing the category name, as well as the description underneath. This was added because when I noticed my parents first using this website, they immediately tried to click the descriptions under "US Open" instead of the category name itself. I'm hoping that this addition makes it easier for everyone :) </td><tr></tr>
        <td class="td3">- New section added to the bottom of the home page. This dark-blue section includes direct links to the Men's Top 5, Women's Top 5, Relay Split Top 5, and Interesting Record Facts pages.</td><tr></tr>
