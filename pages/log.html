    <th class="th2">March 10, 2023</th><tr></tr>
      <td class="gold">New Additions</td><tr></tr>
        <td class="td3">- !!New page added!!: "/men_top5". This page includes the top 5 swims for every male individual event.</td><tr></tr>
        <td class="td3">- Men's individual events are now clickable and will send you to this page to view the Top 5 Swims for said race.</td><tr></tr>
        <td class="td3">- !!New page added!!: "/women_top5". This page includes the top 5 swims for every female individual event.</td><tr></tr>
        <td class="td3">- Just like for the men, women's individual events are now clickable and will send you to this page to view the Top 5 Swims for said race.</td><tr></tr>
        <td class="td3">- On the home page, the buttons for "US Open," "American," and "NCAA" are now larger. The button can be clicked by pressing the category name, as well as the description underneath. This was added because when I noticed my parents first using this website, they immediately tried to click the descriptions under "US Open" instead of the category name itself. I'm hoping that this addition makes it easier for everyone :) </td><tr></tr>
        <td class="td3">- New section added to the bottom of the home page. This dark-blue section includes direct links to the Men's Top 5, Women's Top 5, Relay Split Top 5, and Interesting Record Facts pages.</td><tr></tr>
        <td class="td3">- !!New page added!!: "/log". This page is mostly for me to account the progress I do on a daily or weekly basis, but it could also be interesting for others to see what fixes or changes I make behind the scenes.</td><tr></tr>
      <td class="red">Fixes</td><tr></tr>
        <td class="td3">- Fixed Maggie Mac Neil's incorrect team name in the (i) 50 Fly and (i) 100 Fly top 5. Team name has been changed to University of Michigan for her collegiate swims before the 2022-2023 season. </td><tr></tr>
        <td class="td3">- The header "WOMEN'S US OPEN RECORDS" didn't have "US OPEN" capitalized. Not sure how that one flew by me for so long.</td>
