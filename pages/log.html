  <h2>UPDATE LOG</h2>
  
  <table>
    <th class="th2">March 15th, 2023</th><tr></tr>
      <td class="green">New Records</td><tr></tr>
        <td class="td3">- In the first event of the 2023 Women's NCAA Division 1 Championships, Virginia broke the US Open, American, and NCAA record in the 200 Medley Relay with a 1:31.51.</td><tr></tr>
		<td class="td3">- Leading off this relay, Gretchen Walsh split the 4th fastest 50 Back split in history, a 22.77.</td><tr></tr>
		<td class="td3">- During this relay, Kate Douglass of UVA swam the 2nd fastest 50 Free relay split of all time, a 20.34.</td><tr></tr>
		<td class="td3">- Also during this relay, but on Texas's relay, Anna Elendt swam the 4th fastest 50 Breast split ever, a 25.54.</td><tr></tr>
	<td class="gold">New Additions</td><tr></tr>
        <td class="td3">- On the women's records pages (US Open, American, and NCAA), there is gold text at the top right that says "Records set at 2023 NCAAs." New records set at the 2023 NCAAs will be gold instead of white. Currently, only UVA's 200 Medley Relay time is golden.</td><tr></tr>
	<td class="red">Fixes</td><tr></tr>
		<td class="td3">- Fixed Lilly King's fastest 50 Breast split not appearing on the 3 Women's Records pages. For some reason, her 25.38 was the fastest time shown instead of her 25.36. I'm sorry for any confusion this has caused.</td><tr></tr>
		<td class="td3">- Fixed some spacing issues on the Women's US Open records page. "Speedo Champions Series - Greensboro" was a bit too long of a title, and it caused some words to get overlapped. The "Greensboro" part has been removed.</td><tr></tr>
	</table><br>

<table>
    <th class="th2">March 14th, 2023</th><tr></tr>
      <td class="red">Fixes</td><tr></tr>
        <td class="td3">- Men's 50 Breaststroke Individual Top 5 was fixed: USC's Carsten Vissering actually has the 3rd fastest 50 in history, a 23.29. For the individual 50s (Breast and Fly), it's difficult to find the fastest times ever. Individual 50s for those aren't swam at NCAAs, so the best times I could find came from the 50 split in the 100.</td><tr></tr>
    		</table><br>

<table>
    <th class="th2">March 13th, 2023</th><tr></tr>
      <td class="gold">New Additions</td><tr></tr>
        <td class="td3">- The Florida Spring Senior Champs meet has been published to swimcloud, so Katie Ledecky's record-setting 1650, as well as her 1000, have been linked with the race data.</td><tr></tr>
    		</table><br>

<table>
    <th class="th2">March 12th, 2023</th><tr></tr>
      <td class="green">New Records</td><tr></tr>
        <td class="td3">- Katie Ledecky breaks the US Open and American records in the 1650 Freestyle with a blazing time of 15:01.41!</td><tr></tr>
		<td class="td3">- In this same race, she set the 2nd fastest 1000 Freestyle in history with a 9:02.82, only 3 seconds off the all-time record in the 1000. </td>
    		</table><br>

<table>
    <th class="th2">March 11th, 2023</th><tr></tr>
      <td class="red">Fixes</td><tr></tr>
        <td class="td3">- The home page had an issue where the new "extras" category at the bottom was clipping outside for mobile users. It's now fixed, with the 4 pages being vertically aligned instead of horizontal.</td>
    		</table><br>

<table>
    <th class="th2">March 10th, 2023</th><tr></tr>
      <td class="gold">New Additions</td><tr></tr>
        <td class="td3">- !!New page added!!: "/men_top5". This page includes the top 5 swims for every male individual event.</td><tr></tr>
        <td class="td3">- Men's individual events are now clickable and will send you to this page to view the Top 5 Swims for said race.</td><tr></tr>
        <td class="td3">- !!New page added!!: "/women_top5". This page includes the top 5 swims for every female individual event.</td><tr></tr>
        <td class="td3">- Just like for the men, women's individual events are now clickable and will send you to this page to view the Top 5 Swims for said race.</td><tr></tr>
        <td class="td3">- On the home page, the buttons for "US Open," "American," and "NCAA" are now larger. The button can be clicked by pressing the category name, as well as the description underneath. This was added because when I noticed my parents first using this website, they immediately tried to click the descriptions under "US Open" instead of the category name itself. I'm hoping that this addition makes it easier for everyone :) </td><tr></tr>
        <td class="td3">- New section added to the bottom of the home page. This dark-blue section includes direct links to the Men's Top 5, Women's Top 5, Relay Split Top 5, and Interesting Record Facts pages.</td><tr></tr>
        <td class="td3">- !!New page added!!: "/log". This page is mostly for me to account the progress I do on a daily or weekly basis, but it could also be interesting for others to see what fixes or changes I make behind the scenes.</td><tr></tr>
      <td class="red">Fixes</td><tr></tr>
        <td class="td3">- Fixed Maggie Mac Neil's incorrect team name in the (i) 50 Fly and (i) 100 Fly top 5. Team name has been changed to University of Michigan for her collegiate swims before the 2022-2023 season. </td><tr></tr>
        <td class="td3">- The header "WOMEN'S US OPEN RECORDS" didn't have "US OPEN" capitalized. Not sure how that one flew by me for so long.</td>
