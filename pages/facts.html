	<tr> <p class= "toes"> - Jordan Crooks of the Cayman Islands split 18.90 in the 50 Fly, being the first man under 19 seconds. </p> </tr>

It was almost broken by Bobby Finke in his 1650 Free at the 2020 SECs. Finke took out the first 1000 of his 1650 in 8:34.63, only .70 off Smith's record.  </p> </tr>
