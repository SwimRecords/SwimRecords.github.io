The 1000 Free is usually only swam at meets outside of midseason/conference/NCAAs, so this record may remain untouched for a long time. It was almost broken by Bobby Finke in his 1650 Free at the 2020 SECs. Finke took out the first 1000 of his 1650 in 8:34.63, only .70 off Smith's record.  </p> </tr>

<!-- Ledecky Proof: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMRaOaRqaZU -->
	<tr> <p class= "toes"> - Katie Ledecky swam the 1000 Free in 8:59.65 at a Nation's Capital Invitational in 2015, before she ever swam in college. This record is considered to be one of the fastest of the women's records, and when it was broken, it set the new record by over 10 seconds. Kyle Sockwell, the President of Swimming Twitter, pointed out that for this race, Ledecky went "Out 4:30 back 4:28... lol." </p> </tr>
 	<tr> <p class= "toes"> - Regan Smith's 200 Back time of 1:47.16 was set at a Speedo Champions Series meet in Greensboro, before she swam in college. At this meet, Smith represented Minnesota's Riptide Club Swim Team. </p> </tr>

	<tr> <p class= "toes"> - Once again, Maggie Mac Neil of Canada holds the 50 Back record at a 22.52 leading off for LSU. </p> </tr>
    <tr> <p class= "toes"> - Maggie Mac Neil also has the fastest 50 Fly split in history at a 21.85 at the Art Adamson Invitational in 2022. </p> </tr>
    <tr> <p class= "toes"> - Maggie Mac Neil ALSO has the fastest 100 Free split in history at a 45.26. Both the 50 Back and 100 Free were done at the same meet, the 2023 ACC Championships. </p> <tr>
	<tr> <p class= "toes"> - Anna Hopkin of Great Britain has the fastest 50 Free relay split in history at a 20.27, however this record is debated. Here's what was said on Swimswam the day of the split: "In spite of Hopkin recording a -.05 reaction time, meet officials declared an equipment malfunction when video review showed it clearly that Arkansas’ leadoff leg Kobie Melton touched the pad while Hopkin’s toe was still on the block. It is within the bounds of NCAA rules to overturn the touchpads when officials can confirm a clear equipment malfunction. The video was reviewed by equipment manufacturer Omega, the meet referee, and an SEC admin. A video appears as though the leadoff leg, Kobie Melton, almost took an extra stroke, but on a bit of a weird finish probably registered a soft touch. So, the swim was legal, but that means that the split was probably not quite as fast as 20.27. It was still probably the fastest, or very close to the fastest, swim, as the error in the touchpad didn’t appear to be .18 seconds." </p> <tr>

   	<tr> <p class= "toes"> - Gretchen Walsh has the 100 IM record from a duel meet against Texas in November of 2022. This event, according to a video of the race, was swum unsuited, which is absolutely mindblowing. </p> </tr>
